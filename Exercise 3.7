#write a script to calculate the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 through 5, then print the resulting values in table format,
#using a for loop and the f-string capabilities to form a table with the numbers right aligned in each column.

# print lables for each column

print ("number square cube")

# loop which calculates square and cube of each number in the range
# then prints each number in the range followed by it's squared and cubed products

for number in range(6):
    square = number ** 2
    cube = number ** 3
    print(f'{number:>6} {square:>6} {cube:>4}')
