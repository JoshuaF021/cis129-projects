#write a script to calculate the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 through 5, then print the resulting values in table format,
#using a for loop and the f-string capabilities to form a table with the numbers right aligned in each column.









print(f'{year:>2}{amount:>10.2f}')

uses an f-string with two placeholders to format the loop’s output.

The placeholder {year:>2}

uses the format specifier >2 to indicate that year’s value should be right aligned (>) in
a field of width 2—the field width specifies the number of character positions to use when displaying the value.
For the single-digit year values 1– 9, the format specifier >2 displays a space character followed by the value, 
thus right aligning the years in the first column.
