 
Your python script should run and before each question print out "Answer for Question 1" and then print the answer on the next line.
1. (3 points) Write python code to calculate the sum of 12.8, 18.2 and 0.4 and store it in the variable "total" then display total's value with 2 digits of precision.
2. (3 points) Write python code to prompt the user for a floating point number and print out that number with 2 digits of precision and the type of that number.
3. (3 points) Write a python script to display the diameter, circumference and area of a circle with radius = 3.5.
   Use the following formulas (r = radius, diameter = 2r, circumference = 2*pi*r and area = pi*r^2)
   Use 3.14159 for the value of pi and print out all three calculated values with 2 digits of precision.
4. (3 points) Write a script that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 5. print the resulting values in table format as shown below. 
number    square    cube
0    0    0
1    1    1
2    4    8
3    9    27
4    16    64
5    25    125
Use the tab escape sequence to achieve the three column output.
5. (3 points) Design and if-then statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to variable z if variable x is greater than 100. Set y and z equal to 0 at the beginning. Prompt the user for an integer and then print out y and z.
6. (6 points) A class of ten students took a quiz. Their grades (integers in the range 0 â€“ 100) are 98, 76, 71, 87, 83, 90, 57, 79, 82, 94. Determine the class average on the quiz and print it out using 2 digits of precision. Use a list to store the values.
7. (6 points) Use a for loop and a range function to print the numbers from 33 to 0 decrementing by 3 on the same line, e.g. 33 30 27 24 ... 0
8. (6 points) Write a function called squared(myInt). Call squared which will prompt the user for an integer and return the square of that integer which you will print as an integer.
9. (6 points) Import the random module and print out 10 random rolls of a single die, one per line, e.g.
Roll 1: 1
Roll 2: 5
Roll 3: 3
10. (4 points) Create list1 = [10,20,30]; list2 = [40,50]; concatenated_list = list1 + list2 and print out concatenated_list.
11. (6 points) Set x = 'ABC'. Using the list and join functions, output the string 'A#B#C'.
12. (4 points) Start with the dictionary: country_codes = {'Finland': 'fi', 'South Africa': 'za', 'Nepal': 'np'} and print out only the keys, one per line.
13. (3 points) Using a formatted print statement, print out the character value of the integer 66, e.g. display "Character with ASCII value 66: ???".
14. (4 points) Create a file named "accounts.txt" with mode='w' that contains these 3 lines: '100 Bill 12.34'
'200 Joe 0.00'
'300 Tom 4.21'
Use the "with" and "open" key words. Then open the file as read-only and print out each line.
Extra Credit (10 points). Create a Car class that has 2 fields: year and cylinders. 
It has 5 methods: start_engine which prints "Start your engine", set_year which sets the year of the car, set_cylinders which sets the number of cylinders, get_year which returns the year and get_cylinders which returns the number of cylinders.
Create a Car object called myCar. Set the year to 2020 and the cylinders to 4. Print out the year using the get_year method on one line. 
Print out the number of cylinders using the get_cylinders method on one line and call the start_engine method which should print out "Start your engine" on one line.
