    Here are some further clarifications about the Homework:
    A program that does not work, or crashes, will earn 0 points for the assignment.
    Write generalized routines. Do not have any hardcoded "A", "B", "C" outside of Main.
    Pass variables to generalized functions that return a value.
    ALL numbers in the problem statement MUST be stored in named constants. The section names should also be constants: A, B, C
    Design the program so it will be relatively easy to add a section D to the program by adding some constants and a few statements in main.
    Design the program so it will be easy to change the number of seats in each section or the cost of a seat in each section.
    Display a welcome message with all the constant values (not hardcoded)
    Give a subtotal for all purchases so far after each new purchase
    Display the overall total at the end of the program, and the number of seats and subtotals for each section
